        <p>My comments: "Orange soda" refers to his girl or "Crush" like the soda. He treats her roughly like a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. But she abandons him when he needs her the most. He alludes to a motif in the album of him staying 'ten toes down' or fully committed and then getting dumped by women who don't share his loyalty.</p>
