But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race (Skrrt, skrrt)</pre></h3>
        <p>Song title: The Race</p>
        <p>Artists: Tay-K</p>
        <p>My comments: This song is called "The Race" because Tay-K recorded it while on the run from the police for his involvement in a robbery and murder. He was later sentenced to 55 years in prison.</p>
